An E-commerce Shopping Cart Exercise
This exercise involves working with dummy API endpoints related to an e-commerce shopping cart. Each endpoint returns a JSON-formatted response. Implement the required business functionality by processing these responses and integrating them into your solution.
- Build System: Utilize Gradle for building and managing the project.
- Language: Choose either _Java_ or _Kotlin_ for implementing the solution. (See below for `JavaScript` or `TypeScript` specific changes)
- Design Principle: Opt for object composition over inheritance to promote modularity and flexibility.
- Separation of Concerns: Ensure that functionalities are not mixed; adhere to the Single Responsibility Principle for clear code organization.
- DRY Principle: Avoid code repetition by reusing existing code or creating reusable components.
- Testing: Develop `JUnit` tests to verify the correctness and robustness of your solution.
- Logging: Integrate logging to provide better insights during debugging.
- Interface Implementation: Thoroughly implement all methods in the given interfaces
